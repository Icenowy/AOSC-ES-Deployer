	  "devel" means development. After cutting down this slice, the system
	  won't be able to compile userspace programs written with C, C++ or
	  other compilation languages.
	  Note: "devel" and "compilation" is different, the former one won't
	  remove GNU C Compiler, and so kernel modules (e.g. drivers) can still
	  be built with "devel" cut down.
